For those interested in reproducing these results:

Manually place all 72 text files from the raw data source into a single folder. 

Save the txttocsvmaster.py python file found in MANE-4962-FINAL-PROJECT/notebooks into the aforementioned folder and run it. 
This will generate a master csv file combining the data from all 72 text files. 

Run final_data_processer.py, also found in MANE-4962-FINAL-PROJECT/notebooks. 
This will apply some filters to the data, generate time-independent data based on the time-dependent raw data, and calculate RMS, MAV, and SSC for each signal.
Make sure to modify the second-to-last non-whitespace line where the input file name is hardcoded as needed: 
  | input_csv_path = "master.csv" # <--change this

Run proj_prog_4_initial_classification.ipynb for classification using SVM.

Run final_classification.ipynb for classification using a fully-connected neural net (achieves slightly better results).
